Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Core instructions

- Target macOS 15.2 or later.
- Swift 6.2 or later, using modern Swift concurrency.
- SwiftUI backed up by `@Observable` classes for shared data.
- Do not introduce third-party frameworks without asking first.
- Avoid UIKit unless requested.

## Swift instructions

- Always mark `@Observable` classes with `@MainActor`.
- Assume strict Swift concurrency rules are being applied.
- Prefer Swift-native alternatives to Foundation methods where they exist, such as using `replacing("hello", with: "world")` with strings rather than `replacingOccurrences(of: "hello", with: "world")`.
- Prefer modern Foundation API, for example `URL.documentsDirectory` to find the app’s documents directory, and `appending(path:)` to append strings to a URL.
- Never use C-style number formatting such as `Text(String(format: "%.2f", abs(myNumber)))`; always use `Text(abs(change), format: .number.precision(.fractionLength(2)))` instead.
- Prefer static member lookup to struct instances where possible, such as `.circle` rather than `Circle()`, and `.borderedProminent` rather than `BorderedProminentButtonStyle()`.
- Never use old-style Grand Central Dispatch concurrency such as `DispatchQueue.main.async()`. If behavior like this is needed, always use modern Swift concurrency.
- Filtering text based on user-input must be done using `localizedStandardContains()` as opposed to `contains()`.
- Avoid force unwraps and force `try` unless it is unrecoverable.

## SwiftUI instructions

- Always use `foregroundStyle()` instead of `foregroundColor()`.
- Always use `clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius:))` instead of `cornerRadius()`.
- Always use the `Tab` API instead of `tabItem()`.
- Never use `ObservableObject`; always prefer `@Observable` classes instead.
- Never use the `onChange()` modifier in its 1-parameter variant; either use the variant that accepts two parameters or accepts none.
- Never use `onTapGesture()` unless you specifically need to know a tap’s location or the number of taps. All other usages should use `Button`.
- Never use `Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)`; always use `Task.sleep(for:)` instead.
- Never use `UIScreen.main.bounds` to read the size of the available space.
- Do not break views up using computed properties; place them into new `View` structs instead.
- Do not force specific font sizes; prefer using Dynamic Type instead.
- Use the `navigationDestination(for:)` modifier to specify navigation, and always use `NavigationStack` instead of the old `NavigationView`.
- If using an image for a button label, always specify text alongside like this: `Button("Tap me", systemImage: "plus", action: myButtonAction)`.
- When rendering SwiftUI views, always prefer using `ImageRenderer` to `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`.
- Don’t apply the `fontWeight()` modifier unless there is good reason. If you want to make some text bold, always use `bold()` instead of `fontWeight(.bold)`.
- Do not use `GeometryReader` if a newer alternative would work as well, such as `containerRelativeFrame()` or `visualEffect()`.
- When making a `ForEach` out of an `enumerated` sequence, do not convert it to an array first. So, prefer `ForEach(x.enumerated(), id: \.element.id)` instead of `ForEach(Array(x.enumerated()), id: \.element.id)`.
- When hiding scroll view indicators, use the `.scrollIndicators(.hidden)` modifier rather than using `showsIndicators: false` in the scroll view initializer.
- Place view logic into view models or similar, so it can be tested.
- Avoid `AnyView` unless it is absolutely required.
- Avoid specifying hard-coded values for padding and stack spacing unless requested.
- Avoid using UIKit colors in SwiftUI code.

## SwiftData instructions

If SwiftData is configured to use CloudKit:

- Never use `@Attribute(.unique)`.
- Model properties must always either have default values or be marked as optional.
- All relationships must be marked optional.

## Project structure

- Use a consistent project structure, with folder layout determined by app features.
- Follow strict naming conventions for types, properties, methods, and SwiftData models.
- Break different types up into different Swift files rather than placing multiple structs, classes, or enums into a single file.
- Write unit tests for core application logic.
- Only write UI tests if unit tests are not possible.
- Add code comments and documentation comments as needed.
- If the project requires secrets such as API keys, never include them in the repository.

## Git workflow

- When working on a GitHub issue, use `gh issue develop <issue-number> --checkout` to create and checkout a branch with consistent naming.
- Use conventional commit format for all commits: `type(scope): subject`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
  - Example: `feat(menu-bar): add open output folder button`
  - Keep subject line under 50 characters when possible
  - Use present tense ("add" not "added")

## PR instructions

- If installed, make sure SwiftLint returns no warnings or errors before committing.
